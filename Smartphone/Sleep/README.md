# Sleep Object

## NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

The sleep object will allow you to suspend and enable the BlackBerry Device Software backlight through extending the security timer.
This is accomplished by calling Backlight.enable(true, INTERVAL).

## Tested On

* BlackBerry Torch 9810

**Requires BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphones v2.0 or higher**

## Known Issues
1. The Backlight.setTimeout class allows a max interval of only 255 s. In order to support a persistent backlight 'on' experience, a Timer is used to repeat the call made to enable() every INTERVAL seconds.  This behaviour can be affected by an IT Policy or Application Permission.
2. The user-defined backlight timeout (Device software options screen) cannot be read.  As a result, there is no way to restore the user-defined timeout.  Use Backlight.getTimeoutDefault() instead (default value is 30 seconds).
